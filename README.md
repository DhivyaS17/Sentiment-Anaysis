# Sentiment-Anaysis

Well, this is a python mini project on "SENTIMENT ANALYSIS".
This one is a very basic and easy project with can be done in minutes but the accuracy lies in the data set which we create.

In my project, I've used some python packages to compare the performance of my model with the others, namely Textblob and Vader Sentiment Analyzer.

# Code Explanantion

We calculate the sentiment of the sentence using certain formula after which we compare it against the actual answer, which helps in labeling the precision of the model. There are some predefined inputs(doc1 .txt),
in addition to that, the user can also test the model with their inputs until they reach satisfaction.

The most important note is that only your dataset defines the outcome.
So make sure that your dataset covers all the aspects for the best results.

# Files included :
Emotion_detector - the python code.
positive-dataset - file containing positive words.
negative-dataset - file containing negative words.
doc1 - file containing few sentences which will be considered as input for testing purposes.
